					<p>Frogwares is a Ukranian game studio founded in 2000 whose first game was "Sherlock Holmes and the Mystery of the Mummy." They have since branched out into other literary sources, such as Jules Verne and Lovecraft, but Holmes remains their flagship series. It has nine mainline games (ten if you count the remake of Awakened), and several smaller hidden object games. They are the only major developer putting out Sherlock Holmes-centered games at the moment.</p>
					<p>All of the nine mainline titles are point and click adventure games, although more recent titles include action elements. Most games can be played in either first or third person, with the player primarily controlling Holmes while occasionally controlling other characters such as Watson or Toby.</p>
					<p>Certain of the games are grounded heavily in reality, including some direct adaptations of canon stories, while others use far more imagination. The series was strongly influenced by both the Granada and Lenfilm television adaptaions from the beginning, and in later titles takes some inspiration from BBC's Sherlock and Guy Ritchie's Holmes movies.</p>
